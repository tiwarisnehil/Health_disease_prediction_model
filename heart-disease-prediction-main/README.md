# <b>Heart Disease Prediction</b>

In this project, we have created a Web Based Application that predicts whether the user has a chance of heart disease or not based on some inputs that this web application takes from the user like Fasting Blood Sugar level, Cholestrol level, Resting Electrocardiographic results, etc.

We have used the Flask Framework to connect the front end with Machine Learning model to make the predictions. In the ML model, we have used two Classification Techniques i.e Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbours when classifying whether the user has a chance of a heart disease or not. We ultimately decided to go with KNN as it produced more accurate results than Logistic Regression.
